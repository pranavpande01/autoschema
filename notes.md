LlamaIndex is the framework for Context-Augmented LLM Applications

Workflows are multi-step processes that combine one or more agents, data connectors, and other tools to complete a task.


Data connectors ingest existing data.

Data indexes structure data in intermediate representations.

Query engines are interfaces for quering (e.g. a RAG flow).

Chat engines are conversational interfaces.

Observability/Evaluation enable rigorous experimentation, evaluatiion, and monitoring.

Workflows allow to combine all of the above into an event-driven system far more flexible than other, graph-based approaches.
